# SAMP-Quiz-helper
This app was built for a quiz on a certain server in the SAMP Game, but the code can be easily rewritten when wanting to **_perform an automatic task within milliseconds on a certain change in a text file._**

The user can choose how long the program waits before answering the quiz (for avoiding suspicion of cheat use)

The app is constantly reading the file and waiting for the quiz to appear. If triggered it gives the correct answer in the time that the user chooses prior to starting the app

An example can be seen in the 'Screenshots' folder in the project

The project also contains a runnable .jar file that can be downloaded

When started, the app works by itself, there are no commands or actions needed</br>


#### Warnings: </br>
-Keep in mind that the app uses clipboard for copying and pasting the answer (anything you copied into the clipboard will be lost when the quiz appears)</br>
-Each time the app finds the change in the textfile and performs the task, it clears the whole text file so the program doesn't repeat itself
