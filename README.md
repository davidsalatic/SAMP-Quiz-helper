# SAMP-Quiz-helper

This app was built for a quiz on a certain server in the SAMP Game, but the code can be easily rewritten when wanting to perform an automatic task within milliseconds on a certain change in a text file

The user can choose how long the program waits before answering the quiz (for avoiding suspicion of cheat use)

The app is constantly waiting for the quiz to appear. If triggered it gives the correct answer in the time that the user chooses prior to starting the app
